## ðŸ’» Procedure

### Create a Bitbucket Repository

- Create a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> account if you do not already have one.
- Create a new repository in Bitbucket as shown below.
- Name it ECE487\_LastName\_FirstName.
- Give your instructor read access: Click `Invite` on the top of the right-hand navigation and then click `Add members`. Provide your instructor **read access**. 
    - Dr. Baek: stanley.baek@afacademy.af.edu

```{Note}
Your repository name must be ECE487\_LastName\_FirstName. Otherwise, the instructor may not be able to find your repository.
```

- You may need to create a Bitbucket `app password` as shown below.
- Click `Your Profile` on the top of the right-hand navigation and then click `Personal Settings`. 
- Click `App Passwords` and then click `Create app password`. 
- Write your preferred label and select permissions as shown below.
- Click `Create`.
- Save the password as you cannot view it after you create it.

### Install Git

- Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win to download `64-bit Git for Windows setup`
- Install Git with the default settings. Git is already installed on Mac. 
- Create a folder named `PycharmProjects` under your home folder, e.g., C:\Users\stanley.baek\PycharmProjects. 
- Right-click the `PycharmProjects` folder and select `Git Bash Here` as shown below.   
- From your repository in Bitbucket, click Clone and copy the command that begins with _git clone_ by clicking on the copy button as shown below.  
- Paste it within the Bash terminal (middle-click, right-click > Paste, or `Shift+Ins` to paste) and add a space followed by a _period_ as shown below. The _period_ at the end means that the destination is the _current folder_. Hit Enter.
- If it asks for a password, enter the app password you saved in the previous step.
- Notice that you have `(master)` at the end of the folder name. If you type `ls`, it should return nothing.

- Go to Teams > General > Files > Class Materials. Download the `PycharmProjects_XXXX` folder and copy everything into the `PycharmProject` folder in your home directory. Do not copy the `PycharmProjects_XXXX` folder itself into the `PycharmProjects` folder.  The figure below shows an example of a local `PycharmProjects` folder on your computer.
