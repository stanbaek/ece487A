    "\n",
    "AprilTag is a visual fiducial system, useful for various tasks, including augmented reality, robotics, and camera calibration. We will learn how fiducial markers are used in image processing. Specifically, we will utilize MicroPython to identify different AprilTags and use the 3D position and orientation to determine the distance of an object from the camera.\n",

    "A fiducial marker is an artificial feature used in creating controllable experiments, ground truthing, and simplifying systems development where perception is not the central objective. Examples of fiducial markers include ArUco Markers, AprilTags, and QR codes. Each of these different tags holds information such as an ID or, in the case of QR codes, websites, messages, etc. We will primarily focus on AprilTags as a very robust Python package is already built. This library identifies AprilTags and will provide information about the tag’s size, distance, and orientation.\n",
