# ðŸ”¬ Project1: Inverse Kinematics

## Objectives
The purpose of this project is to compare the theoretical solution to the inverse kinematics with a physical implementation on the 5 DoF robotic arm shown below. In this project, you will
- Parameterize the robotic arm following the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention.
- Use Python to find the closed-form solutions to the inverse kinematic equations for the robot.
- Write a Python script that picks up blocks from known locations and stacks them at a different location.

## ðŸ’» Procedure

### Setup

- Go to ECE487 Teams > General > Files > Class Materials > Python Files.
- Open `proj1_fucntions.py` and copy everything except the `test_inverse_kinematics` function and paste it in your `xarm.py` at the end of `class XArm(rbt.DHRobot)` right before 
```Python
""" ======================================================================
    End of Class XArm
    ====================================================================== """
```

- Copy the `test_inverse_kinematics` function and paste it right before `if __name__ == '__main__':`



### Inverse kinematics of 5 DoF robotic arm

Use the schematic diagram shown in the figure below for the forward/inverse kinematics of the robotic manipulator. Note that L1 is not 0.

:width: 450
:align: center
```

**Note:** Frame {5} is attached to the tooltip because of a bug in the robotics toolbox.  It cannot render the end-effector link correctly if we use `robot.tool = SE3([0, 0, L4])`

Use the following values for B0, L1, L2, L3, and L4. 

```Python
def __init__(self, simulation_only=False):

    self.B0 = 0.090
    self.L1 = 0.010  # <-- Ensure L1 is 0.01.
    self.L2 = 0.105
    self.L3 = 0.088
    self.L4 = 0.174

```


### Deliverable 1 (25 points)

- Complete the code inside the `invkine` method. 
- In your `invkine()`, you must check the operating ranges of joint angles and should not return solutions that violate the operating ranges. Ensure you have the following two lines inside the constructor of XArm (`def __init__(...)`) and use the `check_joint_angle_limits` method to check the ranges before returning from `invkine()`.

``` 
self.max_joint_angle = (pi/2, pi, pi/4, pi/2, pi/2)
self.min_joint_angle = (-pi/2, 0, -3*pi/4, -pi/2, -pi/2)
```

- Demo `test_inverse_kinematics( )` with `simulation_only=False`.  Although it is not required, it is strongly recommended to run `test_inverse_kinematics( )` with `simulation_only=True` to observe the simulation outputs.

### Deliverable 2 (25 points)

Write a Python script that moves a cube located at (25, 0, 0) to (20, 16, 0) and demo your robot moving the cube.  You must use the inverse kinematics, not the forward kinematics with pre-calculated joint angles. You must lift the block no less than 10 cm before placing it down. You may be asked to move the cube from a different location. 


### Deliverable 3 (50 points)

Write a Python script that moves a stack of five cubes located at (23, -15, 0) to (23, 15, 0) and demo your robot moving the cubes.  You must use the inverse kinematics, not the forward kinematics with pre-calculated joint angles.  You may be asked to move the cube from a different location.
