# 💎 Resources

## 📚 Recommended Textbooks 
- Peter Corke, [**Robotics, Vision, and Control**](https://petercorke.com/rvc/home/), Springer, 1st & 2nd ed., free 1st ed [pdf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-20144-8.pdf); easy to read but sometimes skips details.
- Craig, **Introduction to Robotics: Mehcanics and Control**.  Pearson, 4th ed.; most popular textbook and easy to read.  
- Spong, Hutchinson, & Viidyasagar, **Robot Modeling and Control**; alternative to Craig's book, more in-depth math, covers a great deal of contents not covered by Craig.
- Murray, Li, & Sastry, **A Mathematical Introduction to Robotics Manipualtion**, free [pdf](http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/mlswiki/?title=First_edition); must-have book for roboticists, extremeley hard to read. don't read it if you are a biginner - you will hate robotics, UC Berkeley [EE106A/206A](https://ucb-ee106.github.io/106a-fa20site/)

## ➕✖️ Linear Algebra 
- [**Introductioin to Linear Algebra**](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/) by Gilbert Strang - Best Linear Algebra textbook in the world!!
- G. Strang's phenomenal [lecture videos at MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video_galleries/video-lectures/)
- You can also find many of his lecture videos in [YouTube](https://youtu.be/J7DzL2_Na80)
- If you want to go to **graduate school** and study robotics, computer vision, information system, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or data science, you should have a strong background in linear algebra.
