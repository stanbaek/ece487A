## 🏃 Late Policy:  
**If problems arise with graded assignments, see your instructor in advance**

- The cutoff for **on-time submission is 07:00 🕖 a.m.** on the due date. 
- Late days are counted in 24-hour periods. Submitting between 07:00:01 on the due date and 07:00:00 the next day is one day late, and so on.
- You are given **5 grace days (self-granted extensions)** which you can use to give yourself extra time without penalty. No more than **2 grace days** can used for each assignment.
- Instructor-granted extensions are only considered after all grace days are used and only given in exceptional situations. Computer problems such as hard-drive reimaging are **not** considered as exceptional situations and you must use grace days.
- Late work handed in when you have run out of grace is 💥 **discounted 20% for the first day late and 10% per day late thereafter**.
- Every assignment has a hard deadline; **4 days** past the original due date. 
- Late submissions (penalty or not) are not accepted after the hard deadline or after the solution to the assignment is published. No late submissions (penalty or not) will be accepted for the assignments right before GRs.



## 🤝 Collaboration Policy:  

Unless  specifically directed otherwise, the collaboration policy for this course is:

- For all assignments in this course, unless otherwise noted on the assignment, you may work with anyone.  We expect all graded work, including cod and written reports, to be in your own work. Copying another person’s work, with or without documentation, will result in **NO** 🚫 academic credit. Furthermore, copying without attribution is dishonorable and will be dealt with as an honor code violation.
- All help received on work submitted for grading must be documented in accordance with the course documentation 📝 policy.
- GRs are individual efforts. No collaboration is allowed while taking these exams. All electronic devices (phones, smartwatches, computers, tablets, etc.) must be placed out of sight for the duration of the event. If any electronic device is seen during the event, the student will receive a zero for that effort. 
- While working on projects, you may collaborate only with your own team and with the ECE 487 instructor.  
- For graded homework assignments and labs, you may collaborate with any other cadet currently enrolled in ECE 487.  You may also reference the posted answers and solutions.
