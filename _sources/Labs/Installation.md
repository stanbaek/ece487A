### Install Git

- Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win to download `64-bit Git for Windows setup`
- Install Git with the default settings. Git is already installed on Mac. 
- Create a folder named `PycharmProjects` under your home folder, e.g., C:\Users\stanley.baek\PycharmProjects. 
- Right-click the `PycharmProjects` folder and select `Git Bash Here` as shown below.   
- From your repository in Bitbucket, click Clone and copy the command that begins with _git clone_ by clicking on the copy button as shown below.  
- Paste it within the Bash terminal (middle-click, right-click > Paste, or `Shift+Ins` to paste) and add a space followed by a _period_ as shown below. The _period_ at the end means that the destination is the _current folder_. Hit Enter.
- If it asks for a password, enter the app password you saved in the previous step.
- Notice that you have `(master)` at the end of the folder name. If you type `ls`, it should return nothing.

- Go to Teams > General > Files > Class Materials. Download the `PycharmProjects_XXXX` folder and copy everything into the `PycharmProject` folder in your home directory. Do not copy the `PycharmProjects_XXXX` folder itself into the `PycharmProject` folder.  The figure below shows an example of a local `PycharmProject` folder on your computer.

- Go back to Git Bash. If you have already closed it, right click on an empty space inside the `workspace` folder and select `Git Bash Here`.
- Type `git add -A` or `git add -all` and hit `Enter`.
- Type `git commit -m "Initial commit."` and hit `Enter`.
- Type `git push` as shown below

    - git add -A
    - git commit -m "Comment"
    - git push

- Refresh your Bitbucket repository to observe the new files as shown below
